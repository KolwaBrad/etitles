   A Secure Online Land Control Platform for Land Title Deeds Validation
</h2>

### Abstract

 An online platform to ensure secure land transactions and monitoring, while
enhancing the validation of title deeds, is crucial in addressing the challenges and inefficiencies
of land related disputes. By leveraging technology and providing a streamlined and accessible
platform, this project aims to revolutionise the way landowners, buyers, sellers, and government
officials interact with land-related processes. The need for such a platform is to reduce the
occurrences of land disputes and fraudulent transactions by providing a secure and reliable
online environment. The online platform offers immense convenience and accessibility for
stakeholders involved since it provides an additional layer of trust and authenticity to land
transactions. Users can easily access and manage their property information, track transaction
history, and communicate with each other, saving time and effort. Government officials can
efficiently monitor and review land transactions, ensuring compliance with regulations and
detecting irregularities easily, increasing transparency in the real estate market.
